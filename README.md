# Ramaas-Software-Services-Web-Application-Project
Ramaas Software Services, a London-based IT firm, collaborated on the Global Somali Diaspora (GSD) project to unite Somali communities worldwide. As a front-end developer, I implemented a responsive navigation system with a hamburger menu for mobile devices, applied the chosen color palette, and developed a flexible layout using CSS.
